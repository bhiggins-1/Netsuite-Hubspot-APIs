This Anypoint Template should serve as a foundation for setting an online sync of Customers in Netsuite instance to Accounts from Salesforce instance. Every time there is a new Customer or a change in an already existing one, the integration will poll for changes in Netsuite source instance and it will be responsible for creating or updating the Account in Salesforce target instance.

Requirements have been set not only to be used as examples, but also to establish a starting point to adapt your integration to your requirements.

As implemented, this Anypoint Template leverages the [Batch Module](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Batch+Processing).

The batch job is divided in *Process* and *On Complete* stages.

The integration is triggered by a scheduler defined in the flow that is going to trigger the application, querying newest Netsuite updates/creations matching a filter criteria and executing the batch job.

During the *Process* stage, for each Customer from Netsuite instance, we try to find already created Account in Salesforce instance according to Account's name.
The data are adapted for upserting the Account in Salesforce and call the upsert operation in Salesforce system.

Finally, during the *On Complete* stage the Anypoint Template will log output statistics data into the console.

<![CDATA[
To make this Anypoint Template run, there are certain preconditions that must be considered. All of them deal with the preparations in both source and destination systems, that must be made in order for all to run smoothly. 
**Failing to do so could lead to unexpected behavior of the template.**

<![CDATA[
While [creating your application on CloudHub](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Hello+World+on+CloudHub) (Or you can do it later as a next step), you need to go to Deployment > Advanced to set all environment variables detailed in **Properties to be configured** as well as the **mule.env**. 

Once your app is all set and started, there is no need to do anything else. Every time a Customer is created or modified, it will be automatically synchronized to Account in Salesforce as long as it has a Name.

		<section id="api_calls">
		<![CDATA[
Salesforce imposes limits on the number of API Calls that can be made. Therefore calculating this amount may be an important factor to consider. The Anypoint Template calls to the API can be calculated using the formula:

***X + X / ${page.size}***

Being ***X*** the number of Accounts to be synchronized on each run. 

The division by ***${page.size}*** is because, by default, Accounts are gathered in groups of ${page.size} for each Upsert API Call in the commit step. Also consider that this calls are executed repeatedly every polling cycle.	

For instance if 10 records are fetched from origin instance, then 11 api calls will be made (10 + 1).]]>

Functional aspect of the Anypoint Template is implemented on this XML, directed by one flow that will poll for Netsuite creations/updates.
For the purpose of this particular Template the *mainFlow* uses a [Batch Job](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Batch+Processing), which handles all the logic of it.

The several message processors constitute four high level actions that fully implement the logic of this Anypoint Template:
1. Firstly the Anypoint Template will get the Customers polled from the Netsuite instance which matched the filter criteria and for each Customer from Netsuite instance the data are adapted for upserting the Account in Salesforce.
2. Then for each Customer from Netsuite instance, we try to find already created Account in Salesforce instance according to Account's name. The data are adapted for upserting the Account in Salesforce and call the upsert operation in Salesforce system.
3. Finally the Anypoint Template will log output statistics data into the console.

This file contains the Scheduler endpoint that will periodically query Netsuite for updated/created Customers that meet the defined criteria in the query, and then executing the batch job process, where the data serve as input.
